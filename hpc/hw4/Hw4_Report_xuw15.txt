d.
i.Busy-waiting 
When thread number increases from 2 to 50, the execution time decreases. When thread number continue to increase, the execution time remain the same, because of the limited thread increased waiting time to switch among threads.

The accuracy is constant because of the limited precision of referenced value.

ii. Mutex
The execution time decreases when thread number increase from 2 to 50 for the better parallelization;
The execution time increased when threadnumber increases from 50 to 100 for the longer waiting time to switch among many threads.

e. 

For both busy waiting and mutex, the execution time decreases significantly by about 71.7% for the shortened waiting time in LOOP (busy wait) and mutex lock and unock overhead.
