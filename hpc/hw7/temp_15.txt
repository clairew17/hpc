Basic Usage: 
/usr/local/bin/ibrun ./executable <executable_opions>

In normal usage, pass only the MPI executable name and any
options the executable requires.


Advanced Usage:
/usr/local/bin/ibrun -n <number of processors> -o <offset into processor hostlist> executable <execuable_opions>

In this case you can specify a subset of processors from the
list of all hosts on which to run the executable, and an offset into the list
of processors to start numbering.  This allows you to e.g. launch two different
exectuables on two different subsets of the available hosts.

For example, the following  batch environment will allocate 
 two nodes with  tasks per node: 
   #$ -n 
   #$ -N 2 

 We can run two independent jobs on each node:
 /usr/local/bin/ibrun -n  -o 0  ./mpihello &
 /usr/local/bin/ibrun -n  -o  ./mpihello &
 wait

The first call launches a -task job on the first  cores in the hostfile,
The second call launches a -task job on the second  cores in the hostfile.
The shell 'wait' command waits for all processes to finish before the shell exits.
 
ERROR: Do not run /usr/local/bin/ibrun on the login node!
       It must be run on a compute node.
